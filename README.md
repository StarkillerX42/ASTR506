For information about how the Fortran code is structured, the best place to start is integrators.f90 and n_bodies.f90.
 All the actual execution of the models is done via the jupyter notebooks. The performance benchmarks are at the bottom
 of python_tests.ipynb and the solar system model is in solar_system.ipynb
